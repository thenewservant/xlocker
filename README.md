xlocker is a minimal fork of the X11 `xtrlock` screen locker, stripped of any redundancy or triviality, no padlock, no arguments.
It allows to lock the screen without altering it visually.

### Installation
```bash
make
sudo make install
```

### Usage
`xlocker`

The mouse will always be present, but neither the keyboard nor clicks will have any effect. To exit the locked mode, simply enter your password and press the enter key.
